## Midwest_Employment: Exploring Employment Trends in the Midwest: A Comparative Analysis Across States
## Introduction
Employment trends offer insights into the economic health of the Midwest. Analyzing state-level employment metrics can reveal growth, stagnation, or decline patterns, which are important for policymakers and businesses. This study examines Midwest employment data to highlight high and low-performing states, identify long-term patterns, and visualize trends using heatmaps and rolling averages to understand the region’s employment dynamics comprehensively.
### The main objectives of the project are:

• Visualize employment trends over time for each state in the Midwest, identifying key patterns and shifts.

• Perform correlation analysis to explore relationships between employment metrics across states.

• Provide actionable insights through heatmaps, line plots, and comparative analysis to inform economic strategies and interventions.

• Identify high and low-performing states based on employment statistics and trends.
### Key Research Question
How do employment trends and metrics vary across Midwest states, and what patterns can be identified to highlight high and low-performing states over time?
